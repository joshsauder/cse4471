    <h2>Weak Passwords</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h5>What are they?</h5>
    <p>A weak password is considered to be something that is easy to guess by people or computers. It is usually short,
        found in a dictionary, or contains personal information. We like to choose passwords that are convenient to
        remember such as our favorite food, sports team or name of a relative. It is not recommended that you choose
        any easily obtainable personal information for a password. These passwords are often easily guessable by
        hackers. The weaker the password, the easier it is for hackers to gain access to your account by brute force
        attacks.
    </p>
    <p>In order to protect your users using your website, you would want create password requirements for your users
        when they sign up for your website. These requirements may include requiring a specific length, capital letter,
        number, special character, etc. The length requirement is the most important for your users to create strong
        passwords. A password with 4 lowercase letters would take a hacker less than 8 minutes to crack with brute
        force, but a password with 8 lowercase letters would take a hacker up to almost 7 years to crack with brute
        force. Combine this with measures such as adding a capital letter or special character decrease your odds
        of your password being guessed significantly.
    </p>
    <p>In the previous page, there was no password policy which was obviously problematic. The user could enter any
        password of their choosing and successfully sign up for an account. In the example below, an example of password
        requirements that would force your users to create stronger passwords upon sign up.</p>
<h5>Example Time!</h5>
    <div>
        <p>Password must include one special character, one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and a length of
            at least 8 characters.</p>
        <p style="color: red">User Sign Up</p>
        <div class="form-group" ng-controller="passCtrl">
            <label for="user">Username</label>
            <input type="username" class="form-control" id="user" required>
            <label for="pwd">Password</label>
            <input type="password" class="form-control" id="pwd" ng-model="password" ng-change="testPass(password)" required>
            <button class="btn btn-success" ng-click ="success = submit()" ng-disabled="strength < 4"
                    style="margin-top: 2%">Submit</button>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top: 2%">{{success}}</p>
    </div>
