    <h5>How should I secure my passwords?</h5>
    <p>
        Most current password storage techniques involve using industry-standard hashing algorithms. These algorithms
        typically generate a random and unique series of characters, called a salt, and add that to the data to be
        encrypted. The random salt prevents an attacker from easily pre-computing hashes to compare to your hashed
        values. The concatenated string is then fed into the encryption algorithm. The algorithm will hash the
        input. The outputted hashed value will then be fed into the algorithm again, and this process will be repeated
        multiple times to increase the strength of the hash. After hashing has been completed, the hashed password
        values can be stored and used for authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
        If more security is required, the hashed passwords can then be encrypted with a secure encryption scheme, like
        AES. This way, even if an attacker gained access to the hashed passwords, they would have to break the
        encryption before attempting to circumvent the hashing.

    <h5>What sort of hashing algorithm should I use?</h5>
    <p>
        Industry standard algorithms like SHA-512 are considered secure. Or, as an alternative, tools based on bcrypt or
        scrypt, which make use of block ciphers, are also considered secure. In general, most frameworks and platforms
        have access to components designed for securing data like passwords. These tools are usually based on reliable
        algorithms and are a more secure option than trying to create your own password storage method.
