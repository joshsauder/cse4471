    <h2>HTTP Response Splitting</h2>
    <h5>What is it?</h5>
    <p>
        HTTP Response Splitting is an exploit that hijacks HTTP responses to perform other attacks.<br>The exploit
        works by forcing an HTTP response from the application to include carriage return (\r) and line feed (\n)
        characters in the response header. This is accomplished by injecting data with these characters into the
        application.
    </p>
    <h5>How can I prevent it?</h5>
    <p>
        Because the exploit relies on being able to inject data into the system that will be included in the response
        header, filtering user input for dangerous characters can be a helpful countermeasure. Additionally, checking
        data for \r and \n characters before including it in response headers is important. Make sure to filter out
        these potentially dangerous characters somehow.<br>If \r and \n characters cannot be included in response
        headers, then the exploit cannot be used.
