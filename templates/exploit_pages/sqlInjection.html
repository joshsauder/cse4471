    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
        <h5>What is it?</h5>
        <p>SQL Injection is one of the most commonly used website exploitation techniques. Using SQL Injection attackers
            can compromise your data confidentially and integrity, bypass authentication, impersonate a user, or even
            destroy your database all together. SQL Injection can occur in many different forms, but the most common
            involves a user placing malicious SQL code into an input box, like for a username or password. Your database
            then will run this malicious piece of code causing harmful effects to your database that an attacker can
            exploit.
        </p>
        <p>SQL Injection works when a web application directly uses a piece of user input in a SQL query. The entered
            input is stored in a variable which is then concatenated with the other necessary parts of SQL query to
            retrieve data. This makes your database very vulnerable if you do not check the user's input and confirm
            that they haven't entered anything malicious that you would not expect them to.
        </p>
        <p>When getting user input you should not simply store it in variable and blindly concatenate it to form a SQL
            query like shown below.
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            userID = //user entered input<br/>
            query = SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = userID;<br/>
            //execute query
        </p>
        <p>Doing this prevents your application from checking if the user entered input was valid and would allow
            attackers to enter something malicious such as: "DROP TABLE Users" or "OR 1=1" and effectively compromise
            your database entirely or destroy its confidentiality or integrity.
        </p>

        <p>In order to prevent SQL Injection from user input, it is recommended to filter the entered input somehow
            using a regular expression, prepared statement, or parametrized query to confirm that the user input is of
            the correct type, and doesn't contain anything that could harm your data. Many SQL injection prevention
            techniques are built into various programming languages themselves and assist in preventing this exploit.
            Check out the "Guide to preventing SQL Injection" in the Further Reading section for techniques to help
            prevent SQL injection in various different programming languages.

    <h5>Example Time!</h5>
    <div>
        <p>Please input your username into the box below. The username may only contain letter, digit, underscore, and
            hyphen characters. It also must be at least 1 character, but no more than 14 characters.</p>
        <div class="form-group" ng-controller="sqlCtlr">
            <form name="form">
                <label for="input">Enter your username here: </label>
                <input type="text" ng-model="model" id="input" name="input" ng-pattern="regex" required/><br>
                Is the username in the correct format? {{form.input.$valid}}<br>
            </form>
        </div>
