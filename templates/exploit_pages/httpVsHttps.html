    <h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h2>
    <h5>Why is using HTTPS is important?</h5>
    <p>
        HTTPS encrypts data during communications between clients and web servers. For example, if your website uses HTTP
        without HTTPS, your users' data is sent in plaintext in an HTTP request as shown in the previous example. The
        visibility of this text makes your users' data vulnerable. While when using HTTPS, the user's data is encrypted
        and this encrypted value is sent over the Internet. This encryption helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example below, a HTTPS request is depicted showing a user accessing their account information. In this
        case the user's username, password, and credit card number are all encrypted and their encrypted values are
        shown providing more security than simply passing these values in plaintext like in the HTTP example.

        Setting up your website using HTTPS is crucial to protecting your user's data, especially if your site
        deals with confidential information such as credit card information. Check out the links below for more
        information about the benefits of HTTPS. The link titled "HTTP vs. HTTPS Differences" contains a graphic detailing
        the steps necessary to convert your website from HTTP to HTTPS.
