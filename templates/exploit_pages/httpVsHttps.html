    <h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h2>
    <h5>Why is using HTTPS is important?</h5>
    <p>HTTPS or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is communication done using HTTP on a secure encrypted connection using
        Transport Layer Security (TLS), or sometimes referred to as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). HTTPS uses this protocol
        to encrypt data requests between clients and web server. For example, when a user logs into your website using
        a HTTP request, their password is sent in plaintext over the Internet. This text can be easily seen by a hacker
        and which could then gain access to this user's account. While when using HTTPS, the password would be encrypted
        and the encryption would be set over the Internet helping to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. Setting up your
        website using HTTPS is crucial to protecting your user's data especially if your site deals with confidential
        information such as credit card information.
