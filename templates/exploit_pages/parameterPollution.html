    <h2>HTTP Parameter Pollution</h2>
    <h5>What is it?</h5>
    <p>
        HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is an exploit that takes advantage of the way different technologies handle
        parameters in HTTP requests. Click the link at the bottom of the page and navigate to the HTTP Parameter
        Pollution page for a more detailed explanation.

    <h5>How can I tell if my application is vulnerable?</h5>
    <p>
        In principle, HPP prevents a security threat if your web application and security implementation treat repeated
        HTTP parameters differently. Your web application probably has the same behavior across the entire application,
        to try testing with one request and different configurations of parameters to see how the application handles
        them. Compare this to how your security solution is scanning request parameters. If they are different, try to
        reconfigure your security solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        To perform more in depth testing, test each request parameter with three different requests, recording the
        response for each request:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A request with the parameter set to a standard value.</li>
        <li>A request with the parameter set to a tampered or potentially harmful value.</li>
        <li>A request with two occurrences of the parameter, the first with a standard value and second with a tampered
            value</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If the response to the third request is different from both the first and second requests, then your application
        could be vulnerable to HPP.
